1. Make ParallelPrimeSieve exception safe and implement cancellation.

   This requires OpenMP 4.0 which will be released in the coming
   months. More precisely I plan the following design: if an exception
   is caught in one thread this thread cancels all other threads using
   the new `#pragma omp cancel' clause from OpenMP 4.0 (and then
   probably rethrow the exception).
